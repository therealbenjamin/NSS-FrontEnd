  <h2>About Robyn</h2>
  <p>
  <strong>Robyn Rowan Hitchcock</strong> (born 3 March 1953) is an English singer-songwriter and guitarist. While primarily a vocalist and guitarist, he also plays harmonica, piano and bass guitar.
  </p>
  <p>
  Coming to prominence in the late 1970s with <em>The Soft Boys</em>, Hitchcock afterward launched a prolific solo career. His musical and lyrical styles have been influenced by the likes of <em>Bob Dylan</em>, <em>John Lennon</em> and <em>Syd Barrett</em>. Hitchcock's lyrics tend to include surrealism, comedic elements, characterisations of English eccentrics, and melancholy depictions of everyday life.

  He was signed to two major American labels (<strong>A&amp;M Records</strong>, then <strong>Warner Bros.</strong>) over the course of the 1980s and '90s, but mainstream success has been limited. He has maintained a loyal cult following and has often earned strong critical reviews over a steady stream of album releases and live performances.
