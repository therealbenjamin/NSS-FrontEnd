    It's <em>good</em> for everyone to understand that they are to love their enemies, simply because your enemies show you things about yourself you need to change. So in actuality enemies are friends in reverse. <strong>LISTEN</strong> to the silence. And when the silence is <small><em>deafening</em></small>, you're in the center of your own universe.

    Have you urinated? <em>Have you drained your bladder</em>? Are you <em><strong>FREE</strong></em>? Because if you havent it will only come out later. I'm giving you some information that your bodily fluids may penetrate your clothing fibres without warning.

    <strong>LISTEN TO THE SILENCE</strong>. And when the silence is <small><em>deafening</em></small>, you're in the <em>center of your own universe</em>. Never dip lower than you can dip. Did you feel that? Look at me - I'm not out of breath anymore! It's good to yell at people and tell people that you're from <abbr title="Tennessee">TN</abbr>, so that way you'll be safe.

    When you get lost in your <em><strong>imaginatory vagueness</strong></em>, your foresight will become a <strong>NIMBLE VAGRANT</strong>! Sometimes horses cough and fart <em>at the same time</em>, so stay out of the range of its butt muscle because
    <em><strong>A HORSE'S BUTT MUSCLE IS THICK
    </strong></em>.
